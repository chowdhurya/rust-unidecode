//! The `deunicode` library transliterates Unicode strings such as "Æneid" into pure
//! ASCII ones such as "AEneid."
//!
//! It started as a Rust port of [`Text::Unidecode`](http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-1.30/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm) Perl module, and was extended to support emoji.
//!
//! See [README](https://github.com/kornelski/deunicode/blob/master/README.md) for more info.
//!
//! Examples
//! --------
//! ```rust
//! extern crate deunicode;
//! use deunicode::deunicode;
//!
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("Æneid"), "AEneid");
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("étude"), "etude");
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("北亰"), "Bei Jing");
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("ᔕᓇᓇ"), "shanana");
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("げんまい茶"), "genmaiCha");
//! assert_eq!(deunicode("🦄☣"), "unicorn face biohazard");
//! ```

/// This function takes any Unicode string and returns an ASCII transliteration
/// of that string.
///
/// Guarantees and Warnings
/// -----------------------
/// Here are some guarantees you have when calling `deunicode()`:
///   * The `String` returned will be valid ASCII; the decimal representation of
///     every `char` in the string will be between 0 and 127, inclusive.
///   * Every ASCII character (0x0000 - 0x007F) is mapped to itself.
///   * All Unicode characters will translate to a string containing newlines
///     (`"\n"`) or ASCII characters in the range 0x0020 - 0x007E. So for example,
///     no Unicode character will translate to `\u{01}`. The exception is if the
///     ASCII character itself is passed in, in which case it will be mapped to
///     itself. (So `'\u{01}'` will be mapped to `"\u{01}"`.)
///
/// There are, however, some things you should keep in mind:
///   * As stated, some transliterations do produce `\n` characters.
///   * Some Unicode characters transliterate to an empty string, either on purpose
///     or because `deunicode` does not know about the character.
///   * Some Unicode characters are unknown and transliterate to `"[?]"`.
///   * Many Unicode characters transliterate to multi-character strings. For
///     example, 北 is transliterated as "Bei ".
///   * Han characters are mapped to Mandarin, and will be mostly illegible to Japanese readers.
